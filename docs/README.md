# miniRT Documentation

This folder contains visual documentation and diagrams for the miniRT ray tracing project.

## Diagram Files

### Parsing Flow Diagrams
- **PARSING_FLOW.drawio** - Basic parsing flow diagram showing the main parsing steps
- **PARSING_FLOW_LINKED.drawio** - Enhanced parsing flow with linked list operations

### Rendering System Diagrams
- **lighting_system_explained.drawio** - Visual explanation of the lighting system implementation
- **lighting_visualization.drawio** - Lighting calculations and visual representation
- **sphere_intersection_explained.drawio** - Ray-sphere intersection mathematics and implementation

### Mathematical Concepts
- **vector_operations_explained.drawio** - Vector mathematics used throughout the ray tracer

## How to View

These files are created with [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) and can be opened in:
- The online draw.io editor
- VS Code with the draw.io extension
- Any application that supports the .drawio format

## Purpose

These diagrams serve as:
- Visual documentation for complex algorithms
- Learning aids for understanding ray tracing concepts
- Reference material for debugging and optimization
- Documentation for code reviews and project understanding
